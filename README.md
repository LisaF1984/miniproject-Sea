Mini Project - Lisa Francis SEA

.Why are we doing this?
As a cohort group we are looking to understand how much knowledge we have captured 
from our recent Java training and how capable we are to demonstrate on an individual 
basis our level of development. 
This will highlight our strengths and any areas of improvements to focus on as our 
development progresses. 
I want to show that i can create a backend functionally that speaks to the front end using api. 
using Eclise java for back end incorporating spring boot, Mysql h2 console to be able to view in a database. 
using live server to create HTML and Js files for front end with its console to view elements linking back into 
H2 console to view tables of information passed in. 

.How i expect the challange to go.
From recent observations i feel the back end of spring usuage will be easier for me to complete, 
with relation to HTML & JS this will me a bigger challange where i understand from the theory angle 
i am yet to try these from a practical sense. 

.What went well?
As previously mentioned the back end spring functionality was completed quicker than other 
axpects of the project, i found i became very motivated to be a little creative with the project 
rather than just show backend and front end functions that link together i wanted to have something
that linked the title of sea and make a little more fun. 


.What didnt go as planned?
I hit a few walls with functionality in HTML front end, the visual side was easy to complete 
however submiting responses and having visual lists on the database show was difficult. 
My github capability was also a challange however looked back at previous notes and recording to assit. 
i did encounter a few problems with importing a number of mapping 
functions however these are now rectified. i also hit a few syntax errors in my   console which delayed
moving forward to completion. 

.Possible improvements for future revision of the project. 
i would like to explore the feature bootstrap has to offer more, i spend sometime looking over the
site however did have a few issues with importing the code to a working feature in my own project. 
I would also like to understand the full extend of axios as a CRUD funtion.
